# Orchestration — Kernel v0.2.0

## Mode declaration

Each phase declares its mode in [`phases.md`](phases.md):

- **`inline`**: lenses run sequentially in the current thread, sharing accumulated context. Used in Discovery. The habitual order is mandatory for a full round and a preference otherwise: `/round <lens>` runs one lens alone, in any order (`phases.md` → *Rounds*).
- **`council-independent`**: each lens runs as a Task subagent (concurrent), seeing only `context.json` + a thematic Shared Understanding excerpt. The chairman synthesizes outputs. Used in Framing/Options/Decision.

## Evidence contract — parse once, reason many

*This section was previously titled "Reading input documents". Existing pointers to that name — lens skills, persona agents, `aisa-capture`/`aisa-frame`/`aisa-options`, `docs/PROCESS_CAPTURE_SPEC.md` — resolve here; they are updated in Phases C–E, no migration required.*

```text
raw inputs
    ↓
ingest/extract once
    ↓
shared usable evidence
    ↓
multiple lenses reason
    ↓
raw source inspected selectively when needed
```

**Parse once. Reason many.** The capture pass — not the lens — is what must open and PARSE every file under `<engagement>/inputs/`. It runs once per engagement (and again only on a stale hash, see `aisa-capture`), and its normalized output is the evidence surface every lens and council persona reads. No lens is required to enumerate or re-parse `inputs/`.

**Shared evidence surface.** Normalized evidence lives in `<engagement>/_capture/`; its entry point is `_capture/evidence-index.md` — one table for the engagement: source · format · normalized file · status · provenance unit. The orchestrator carries that index into every lens and persona invocation. When an engagement has no `_capture/` yet, the invocation says so and raw `inputs/` is the surface.

**Capture tiers.**

| Source | Tier | What the lens gets |
|---|---|---|
| `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` | specialized deterministic capture (L1 extraction + L3 replay + L2 process model — `docs/PROCESS_CAPTURE_SPEC.md`) | `process-model.md` (`PM-NNN` business rules with cell citations) + `*.replay.md` |
| `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.vtt`, `.srt`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv` | **capture-lite** (`library/kernel/tools/text_extract.py`, deterministic) | `_capture/<file>.text.md` — loss-minimizing text extraction with provenance markers (`§<heading> ¶NN`, `p.N`, `[HH:MM:SS] <speaker>`, `¶NN`, `linha N`); where the source carries process semantics, the L2 pass folds them into the cross-source synopsis (`process-model.md` §4) with those locators |
| anything else | not captured (not a failure) | raw inspection per the format table below |

Capture-lite is **loss-minimizing extraction with provenance, never semantic summarization**: everything the source said, plus where it said it. No LLM in the text path. The **L2 process model** (LLM, `aisa-capture` step 5) is the one comprehension pass and reads **all** normalized evidence — extraction JSON, replay reports and `*.text.md` — selected through `evidence-index.md`: **source-complete in coverage, never source-total in simultaneous context**. Every process-bearing source receives a disposition (`USED` / `CHECKED` / `TARGETED`) in `_capture-log.md`; there is no source count, size or length threshold — the contract is *enough evidence inspected to reconstruct the material process*. Its §4 is the engagement's durable process synopsis: normalized evidence, richer than the Shared Understanding, never authoritative over it. A source whose extraction is `failed`, `skipped` or `empty` — the index says which, and why — is read raw with the table below; so is any format outside the tiers.

**Raw inspection.** `inputs/` is read-only primary evidence and is always openable — no gate, no manifest, no permission step. Pick the tool by format:

| Format | How to read |
|---|---|
| `.json` | read directly |
| `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` | the `xlsx` skill, or `openpyxl` with `data_only=False` **and** `data_only=True` (two passes: formulas, then cached values). Data profile: sheets, columns, row counts, value distributions, date ranges. **Logic profile** (obrigatório quando a folha tem colunas derivadas): grafo de dependências entre folhas, histograma de funções, intervalos nomeados agrupados por prefixo, células com `#REF!`, fórmulas que quebram o padrão da coluna |
| `.pdf` | the `pdf` skill |
| `.docx` | the `docx` skill |
| `.pptx` | the `pptx` skill |
| images | read directly (vision) |

**Raw verification is materiality-based.** Shared extraction is the normal evidence surface. Inspect the raw source when it is **material to confidence**: extraction may have lost relevant detail; a material claim depends on interpretation; evidence conflicts; provenance is insufficient; or the lens needs context the extraction did not preserve. **Verify raw evidence when material to confidence, not to satisfy a quota.** There is no per-round spot-check quota, for any lens or persona. Isto limita o **spot-check**, não a compreensão: onde a captura declarou `TO-READ` (`aisa-capture` princípio 1) ou o process-model não tem §4bis para uma fonte estruturada, abrir a fonte **é** a acção material — não é quota, é a leitura em falta.

**Evidence integrity** (invariant — the one evidence rule that stays visible in every lens file):

- Never record a `Confirmed` or `Assumed` row citing evidence you have not opened. Cite the specific value, column or passage — never a filename alone. Citing `PM-NNN` counts as opened (PM rows carry cell citations; SU evidence format `PM-NNN → Sheet1!D2:D400`). A text locator is a plain string in the `evidência` column (`<file> · §<heading> ¶12`, `<file> · p.7`, `<file> · [00:12:34] <speaker>`) — no new id namespace.
- **A lens must not claim stronger evidential support than the evidence it actually inspected supports.** Weaker support → `Assumed` with the basis declared, or `Unknown`. What `Confirmed` requires — locator class, claim level, who may confirm — is owned by `states.md` → *Confirmed threshold*.
- Raw sources are **authoritative on conflict**: a mismatch between the extraction and the raw source becomes a `Conflicted` row citing both, and flags a capture re-run in `_capture-log.md`.
- Anonymized or obfuscated input is still evidence: structure (columns, counts, dates, distributions) is valid.

Epistemic semantics of what gets written (`verificado_em`, `validade`, `custo`, `swing`, transitions, expiry) are owned by [`states.md`](states.md) and are not restated here or in lens files.

## Comprehension survival — what must not be silently lost

```text
reason deeply → persist selectively → claim conservatively → rehydrate selectively → revalidate when premises change
```

aisa does not replace natural reasoning with deterministic cognition. Determinism governs **what must survive**, **what authority owns it**, **what may not be silently promoted or dropped**, **what must be revalidated** and **what a fresh session must reload** — never the order of hypotheses, the number of passes, or how a lens reads a transcript. **Constrain semantic survival, not internal cognition.**

**Compression is allowed.** Every boundary (capture → SU → Framing → Options → Decision → Architecture → deliverables) compresses. The boundary question is: *what material meaning could be lost if this representation replaces the richer one for downstream reasoning?* A downstream artefact may omit detail, never the obligation. Semantic classes that may not be lost **silently**:

| Class | Owner | Durable carrier | Projections |
|---|---|---|---|
| business invariant — a behaviour that must remain valid regardless of the chosen solution | SU row (`Confirmed`/`Assumed`, phrased as behaviour) | `process-model.md` §4 | `frame.md` survival block → Options personas → blueprint |
| structural constraint — a confirmed or unresolved condition whose truth could materially eliminate, reshape or gate whole solution classes | SU row (`Confirmed`, or `Unknown` with `swing: decisivo`) | SU | `frame.md` survival block → Options blocking set → architecture |
| decision-changing Unknown | SU `Unknown`, `swing: decisivo` | SU | `frame.md` survival block, `/status` agenda, `/simulate` |
| material scope / output family · material user task · material transformation obligation · material exception | SU row, projected from the synopsis by disposition | `process-model.md` §4 | frame → options → blueprint → spec |
| material control obligation | SU row / Options concern / decision condition | `decisions.md` | blueprint (structural choice when the store moves) |

No new state, no new field, no register, no matrix: these are existing SU semantics plus one projection slot in `frame.md`. Placement of a structural constraint: Discovery/Framing identify it generically → Options evaluates candidate-specific consequence → Architecture implements the response. Technology neutrality stays binding: user population and identity class, the existing entitlement boundary and the willingness to acquire incremental entitlement are pre-Options facts; candidate-specific entitlement is Options; exact licensing composition is Architecture. No product-licensing question is asked pre-Options because a pack is active.

**Material semantic disposition (Discovery projection boundary).** Every material synopsis line (output family, transformation obligation, invariant, user task, exception, structural constraint) and every `PM-U` row receives exactly one disposition, written in the lens's `Open evidence` block: `MAP <SU id>` — already represented · `ADOPT → <new id>` — row created · `DISMISS — <reason>` — explicitly non-material for downstream decision reasoning. No silent fourth outcome. A **Critical** `PM-U` may remain `Unknown` after adoption; it may never disappear. Visibility is mandatory, closure is not. The synopsis markers project as: `OBSERVED` → `Confirmed` when the evidence supports it — with a locator of the five classes and a claim at the level of that evidence (`states.md` → *Confirmed threshold*) · `INFERRED` → `Assumed` with basis · `HYPOTHESIS` → stays in the synopsis or projects as the `Unknown` that would settle it · `UNKNOWN` → `Unknown`. Rich reconstruction → selective material projection → compact SU: the SU grows by what changes an option's viability, scope or shape, never by the synopsis's size.

**`PM-U` about the artefact's mechanics — a content test, not a signal test.** A `PM-U` about how the old artefact is built (protection, hidden sheets, formats, range names, column or row counts, recalculation order) receives `ADOPT` only when the lens declares which **form, volume or rule of the to-be's data** changes with the answer. If the answer only changes the control or the look of the old artefact, the disposition is `DISMISS — mecânica do as-is`, with that reason written. Two sheets of the same shape are mechanics; four hidden sheets that decide whether the to-be carries 212 or 465 derived columns are data (`PM-U-003` in pilot-3) and keep rising. The L1 inventory remains the authorized draft source of fields in Architecture (P-6): dismissing a mechanics `PM-U` in Discovery loses nothing that Architecture will need, because the inventory, not the `PM-U`, carries it. A Critical `PM-U` dismissed on this ground is still a disposition — it never disappears silently.

**The coverage record is where the disposition stops being a promise.** Every class above already owes a disposition — `MAP` / `ADOPT` / `DISMISS`, the projection slot in `frame.md`, the structural choice, the proof obligation. What the coverage review adds is not a new state, a new owner or a new taxonomy: it is the **verifiable form** of the same obligation, at the two boundaries where compression has historically lost it — sources → record (`reconciliation`) and record → design (`blueprint`). The denominator is built from the sources by the motor, so omitting an obligation and its review line together no longer produces a green; `covered` needs a target that resolves; retiring a material obligation needs an authority that allows it. Definitions stay where they are (`states.md` owns the five states, this file owns the semantic classes, `coverage-contract.md` owns the record); the review cites them and redefines none. And it proves nothing about meaning: the motor verifies the **form** of the declaration, the reviewer signs the judgement, and *reviewed* is never *approved* and never *works end to end*.

**Fact ≠ fit.** A technical or configuration fact (a connection exists, a gateway is configured, a capability is documented) is never, by itself, an architecture-fit conclusion. Where a proposition is architecture-significant **and** is used to settle or materially support a structural architecture conclusion, it closes only on one sufficient basis — authoritative RESEARCH / Domain Knowledge read against the material requirements (exclusions included), engagement-verifiable technical evidence from an accountable source, or a proof / measurement / spike — otherwise the engagement fact is recorded and the structural choice stays open (`aisa-answer`, `aisa-blueprint`). Capability confirmed ≠ fit confirmed.

**Targeted revalidation.** When a new or changed material fact contradicts or materially changes a premise that downstream reasoning used, the conclusions materially based on it are named and marked for revalidation — through the references that already exist (`su_refs`, anchors, `forced_by`, conditions, proof obligations, open architecture choices, tripwires, the blueprint log), never through a dependency graph or a new field. No automatic reversal; no rerun of all phases. Where the Decision basis may have moved: tripwire check → `/revisit`. Architecture never rewrites the Decision.

**Phase ≠ session.** A phase may span many sessions; several phases may run in one. Session context is a **disposable cache**; repository engagement state is the **durable memory**. A fresh session must not depend on the previous transcript and reloads **selectively**: phase authority + SU material state + the process synopsis where relevant + the current phase artefact + targeted evidence / Domain Knowledge pulls — never all raw evidence, all transcripts, all lens outputs or all Domain Knowledge (`aisa-status` → *Read to resume*). No handoff-summary artefact: the canonical artefacts are the memory.

## Orchestrator boundaries

`aisa-round`, `aisa-frame`, `aisa-options`, `aisa-capture`, `aisa-status` and `aisa-start` are execution machinery. **Orchestrator = context provisioning + execution coordination, not domain reasoning.**

An orchestrator **may**:

- provision shared evidence (the `_capture/` index above) and the engagement files a lens would otherwise enumerate;
- resolve the active pack (`_state.json.pack` → `library/packs/<pack>/pack.yaml`);
- inject that pack's relevant `lenses_config.<lens>.extra_signals` as attention cues;
- make `question-bank.md` available at the one step that formulates questions;
- carry round bookkeeping (current round id, next free SU id per section);
- provide the common council execution mechanics and the persona return schema.

An orchestrator **must not**:

- decide what evidence means, or which evidence is relevant;
- classify findings on behalf of a lens (no state assignment, no claim phrasing);
- select architecture, or perform any domain reasoning;
- convert signals into mandatory checklist coverage;
- become a routing or rules engine.

If a revision has the orchestrator scoring evidence relevance, ranking signals, or selecting questions, that is the line being crossed.

## Pack context — Discovery vs Options

**The six Discovery lenses** (`business`, `operations`, `user`, `data`, `governance`, `financial`):

- are pack-agnostic — they never read `pack.yaml` and never resolve the active pack;
- receive a small list of pack-specific attention cues injected by the orchestrator: *"Pack attention cues (`<pack>`): a, b, c — cues, not a checklist; uncovered cues are not gaps."* Empty or absent key → nothing injected;
- stay vendor- and solution-neutral (`.claude/rules/no-tech-mention-before-options.md`).

**Signals are attention cues, not checklist items.** Universal signals belong to the lens itself; pack signals arrive by injection. Neither creates coverage obligations: no rule requires that every signal be covered, and an uncovered signal is not a gap and does not become an `Unknown`.

**`lens-technology`** is the documented exception:

- Options-only (never Discovery, never Framing);
- pack-aware — it may resolve the pack and selectively consult `decision-tree.md`, the relevant `domain-knowledge/*.md`, and `lenses_config.technology.constraints_to_check`;
- it does **not** load the complete domain-knowledge base by default. **Domain knowledge is pull-based, not push-based.**

The exception does not travel: a Discovery lens reading `pack.yaml` is a contract violation, not a precedent.

## Question bank — runtime role

`pack.yaml → question_bank` (e.g. `library/packs/pp/question-bank.md`) is a **question-generation resource**. It is **not permanent context for every Discovery lens**, and no lens or council persona loads it.

It is consulted selectively, at question-generation time, to phrase askable questions around material `Unknown` / `Conflicted` / `Risky` rows and evidence gaps. Intended single consumer: the existing question-generation step in `aisa-status` (which builds the meeting agenda from open Unknowns) — one consumer by design, since two would drift. *(Consumer not yet wired; the contract is stated here first.)*

## Inline mode

- Order is fixed in `phases.md`: `business → operations → user → data → governance → financial` (Discovery).
- Each lens reads: `context.json`, `shared-understanding.md`, `lens-outputs/` (of previous lenses in this round), and the shared evidence the orchestrator carries in (`_capture/evidence-index.md`).
- Each lens writes: rows to the Shared Understanding + `lens-outputs/<lens>.md`.
- The orchestrator skill (`aisa-round`) drives the sequence.

## Declared technical premises (P-25)

A technical premise the owner states in conversation — a store, a surface, an access mechanism, a
bridge between layers, a delivery convention, a reference implementation — is **recorded in the same
turn**, as a row in the Shared Understanding (`Confirmed` when it is a declaration within the owner's
authority, `Assumed` with the basis otherwise) and, in Options, as an architecture axis of the
candidates it touches. Two answers are not available: *absorbed for later* and *it enters when the
next command runs*. A premise held only in the conversation is lost at the end of it, and the command
that was supposed to absorb it has no way to know it existed — which is exactly how a declared
decision axis ends up missing from the artefact that compares the candidates. The user may decline to
record; the offer is never *we will use it without recording it*.

## Council-independent mode

- 6 or 7 agents launched **in parallel via concurrent Task subagents**.
- Each agent receives:
  - `context.json` (read-only).
  - A thematic Shared Understanding excerpt curated by the orchestrator (e.g., for the data lens: only `lens: data` rows).
  - The shared evidence for this engagement (`_capture/evidence-index.md`, and `process-model.md` when it exists) — see *Evidence contract* above. Raw `inputs/` stays openable; a persona is not asked to parse every file.
  - It does **not** receive other agents' outputs in-flight.
- Each agent has `tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]` (no Write).
- When all agents return, the `chairman-synthesis` skill:
  - Reads all agent outputs.
  - Identifies overlaps, gaps, contradictions.
  - Writes new rows to the Shared Understanding.
  - Writes `chairman-synthesis-<round>.md` in `lens-outputs/` (`F-<NN>` in Framing, `O-<NN>` in Options — the Decision phase runs no council synthesis).

**Common council mechanics live here, not in the persona files.** The invocation carries them, authored once and used verbatim by `aisa-frame` step 5 and `aisa-options` step 5: read-only tool grant · no in-flight peer reads · the persona returns, never writes · the two hard rules that bind a read-only persona (no vendor/product naming outside Options; no `Confirmed` without evidence) · the persona return schema (owned by `chairman-synthesis`, its only consumer) · the shared-evidence pointer (see *Evidence contract* above) · the pack attention cues.

**Persona boundary.** **Agent = independent perspective + mandate.** A persona file (`.claude/agents/<persona>.md`) carries primarily: identity, perspective, phase mandate, what it challenges, and its memory binding. It does **not** duplicate kernel state semantics (`states.md`), orchestration, full lens procedures, common output schemas, or domain knowledge. **A council persona is not required to re-read its lens `SKILL.md`** — the invocation carries what binds it, and one channel is chosen deliberately: two would drift. Only `solution-architect` reads pack domain knowledge, pull-based and Options-only (see *Pack context* above).

## Dialectic round

Full peer review was rejected for cost. Its surgical replacement: when the chairman detects **material divergences** between persona outputs (claim vs counter-claim that would change the phase artefact), the orchestrator runs an antithesis round for those points ONLY — each side attacks the other's strongest thesis and returns `Concedo / Contesto / Síntese proposta`. Cap: **3 divergences × 2 calls = ≤6 extra passes** per council round. Divergences that survive the antithesis become Conflicted rows; the chairman never silently picks a winner. Thesis → antithesis → synthesis, only where there is real disagreement.

## Why parallel (not sequential isolated)

Concurrent Task subagents complete the council round in ~1 LLM-pass-time, versus ~6× for sequential isolated. Claude Code supports parallelism natively for the Task tool. There is no race-condition risk because agents do not share writable state.

## Peer review (omitted in MVP)

Karpathy's full pattern includes peer review (each agent comments on the neighbor's output). aisa omits the full version by cost; the **dialectic round** above is its surgical replacement — antithesis only where personas materially disagree.

## Cost envelope per engagement

- Discovery: ~6 lenses × ~2-3 rounds = 12-18 LLM passes (inline, cheaper per pass).
- Framing: 6 agents + 1 chairman = 7 passes (council) + 0-6 dialectic passes (only on material divergence).
- Options: 7 agents + 1 chairman = 8 passes (council, technology enters) + 0-6 dialectic passes.
- Decision: interactive (user-driven) + optional 1 solution-architect review (`/decide --consult`) + auto synthesize (5 topic packs) = 5-7 passes.
- Render: 6 deliverables × 1 composition pass = 6 passes.

**Total per engagement**: ~40-50 LLM passes.
