# Implementation Spec — {{solution_name}}

> Actionable build specification. Audience: implementation team (PP / OS / Mendix / custom — pack-specific). Each section maps to a concrete deliverable the dev team owns; if a section is thin, the engagement is not ready to build and must loop back to the decision or synthesis layer.

## 1. Arquitectura escolhida
{{chosen_architecture}}

## 2. Entidades a criar
> One row per entity: name, owner, fields (name · type · required · default), relationships, indexes (where applicable).

{{entities_to_create}}

## 3. Ecrãs / componentes a construir
> One block per screen/component: name, type (List / Form / Detail / Dashboard / Admin), data sources, key controls, behaviour notes.

{{screens_to_build}}

## 4. Fluxos a implementar
> One block per flow: trigger, source/destination, steps, error handling, idempotency, schedule (if any).

{{flows_to_implement}}

## 5. Modelo de segurança e roles
> Roles + permissions matrix (screen × entity × CRUD). Sign-off rules (separation of duties).

{{security_roles}}

## 6. Integrações
> Per integration: system, direction (in/out/two-way), connector/API, authentication, frequency, DLP classification.

{{integrations}}

## 7. Cenários de teste
> Scenario per friction point + exception identified in as-is. Each: pre-condition, steps, expected outcome, acceptance criterion.

{{test_scenarios}}

## 8. Sequenciamento (sprints / waves)
> Recommended build sequence with dependencies. Identifies what must land first.

{{sequencing}}

## 9. Notas de migração de dados
{{migration_notes}}

## 10. Pontos pendentes de validação
{{open_assumptions_list}}
