# Hooks — aisa

All hooks are written in **Python 3** (single source-of-truth, cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux). Wired in `.claude/settings.json` via `python "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.claude/hooks/<name>.py"` (see *Invocation and the project root* below — a relative command breaks the moment the session's cwd moves). `pre-write-guard.py` **enforces** (hard-blocks writes to `library/`), `on-su-change.py` regenerates the living dashboard; the other 3 are log-only stubs until they gain validation logic. **No hook is the mechanism**: every check a hook surfaces also runs explicitly from the skill that owns it, with the CLI command printed in its own steps — a session where no hook fired loses visibility, never enforcement.

| Hook | Trigger | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-write-guard.py` | `PreToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Hard-blocks** writes to `library/*` (exit 2 + `permissionDecision=deny`). **Fails closed**: enforce is the default, an unset `AISA_GUARD_MODE` also means enforce. `AISA_GUARD_MODE=log` is the administrative override (warn only). |
| `pre-authority-guard.py` | `PreToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Hard-blocks** a write to an engagement's authority when the kernel has not reconstructed its state (exit 2 + `permissionDecision=deny`). The authorities are `shared-understanding.md`, `decisions.md`, `answers.md` and `_state.json` (and the `_state.json.tmp` the skills write before `mv`) at the engagement root, plus everything under `_graph/`, `_ops/`, `_migration/`, `_work/` and `_design/` — coordinated state written by `operation.py` / `migrate.py` in Python, which does not pass through this hook. A `Write`/`Edit` against those directories is by construction a hand edit of coordinated state and is **always** refused, ready or not (handoff-v1 F1.4, F0 D05). An engagement created by the historical version (no `workflow` block in `_state.json`) is not ready: the bootstrap says so and names `jorgedrestevao/aisa@85baf10` (decision classic A). On a ready engagement, a write to `_state.json` that drops an existing key or changes the `workflow` block (profile and route) is refused too — the block changes only through `workflow.py` and the coordinator. In a `handoff-v1` engagement, a write to the SU that adds or changes a `Confirmed` row — an in-place promotion with the same id included (F0 D19) — without a locator of the *Confirmed threshold* classes whose target exists is refused: agreement between personas is not evidence (T08). The checker is the motor's `audit_confirmed_locators`, the one `/status` reads. It calls `bootstrap.py` and refuses unless `ready`; the refusal carries the limitation AND the action that clears it. **Fails closed**: a bootstrap that cannot be evaluated is not the same as one that was evaluated. A folder with no `_state.json` is `/start` creating it — nothing to reconstruct, so it passes. `AISA_GUARD_MODE=log` is the administrative override. |
| `phase-completeness.py` | `Stop` | **Active.** When the turn ends, checks whether the current phase's skill wrote everything its `Outputs (written)` section promises — `frame.md` + the single sentence + `chairman-synthesis-F-NN.md` + the analyst's proposal and the reviewer's findings in `_council-prep` (six persona excerpts on the historical version) + SU rows for the round + council-log (and, separately, the validation closure: `D-001` and the story episode). Same for Options (with a profile, handoff-v1 F5.4: candidates published, the option count by route — three only on `solution-choice`, fewer with `reduction_reason`; one admitted on the other routes — every mandate received and every finding of a current review disposed; on the historical version, 7 persona excerpts and ≥3 options; always the recommendation section, and the `DO-NOTHING` / `PROCESS-CHANGE` class-coverage lines declared in the round's log — the **declaration**, never the class) and Decision (`D-NNN`, 5 topic packs, SU row, frozen counterfactuals — plus, **only once a non-draft blueprint version actually exists**, the reconciliation review and the coverage review of the current version; right after `/decide` there is no design to cover, so nothing is asked and nothing is reported). Reports to stderr, **never blocks**, always exits 0. Silent when the phase is complete. Runs standalone too: `python .claude/hooks/phase-completeness.py --engagement <slug>`. |
| `pre-profile-check.py` | `PreToolUse` on `Skill` | **Hard-blocks** a skill that writes (`aisa-*`, `lens-*`, `chairman-synthesis`, except the read-only `aisa-status`, `aisa-orient`, `aisa-start`) on an engagement created by the historical version, **before** it starts — so a refused `/capture` leaves no derived files behind (handoff-v1 F1.4, decision classic A). Registered before the other `Skill` hooks. The engagement is the named one (`--engagement <slug>`) or the only one mounted; with several mounted and none named it does not guess, warns and lets it through — the authority guard and the coordinator still refuse the write itself. `AISA_GUARD_MODE=log` is the administrative override. |
| `phase-gate-check.py` | `PreToolUse` on `Skill` | **Active.** Before `aisa-frame`/`aisa-options`/`aisa-decide` runs, evaluates the exit criteria of the phase that is ENDING (`library/kernel/phases.md`, via `dashboard.py::gate_state`). Each criterion carries its **mode** — `codigo` (a count, a presence, a marker), `juizo` (the skill judges: the comprehension test), `n/a` (nothing mechanical to read: `decision-tree.md` consulted). Coverage is declared as *n de m por codigo*, never as *gate OK*, and a per-option criterion with zero options is `n/a`, never a vacuous ok. Writes one append-only line to `<engagement>/gate-log.md` — the only writer of that file — with an id that fingerprints the STATE judged (ids of the open rows, sha of `decisions.md`/`options.md`/`frame.md`/the lens outputs, plus each criterion's result), so a later `--override` line carries `refers: <same id>` when nothing moved and a new id with `refers: none` when it did. The engagement is explicit (`--engagement <slug>`, passed by the three commands); with several mounted and no slug it writes NOTHING and says `not evaluated (ambiguous engagement)`. Reports, never blocks, exits 0. **Since the audit of `212cdc6` it also consults the kernel** (`bootstrap.py`) and appends `· kernel: <limitation>` to the line when the state is not reconstructed — the criteria are still computed and written. The limitation rides ALONGSIDE the verdict, never instead of it: this is a soft METHODOLOGICAL gate, and turning it into an integrity block is a different thing. What blocks on integrity is `pre-authority-guard.py`. |
| `on-su-mirror.py` | `PostToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Active — detector, never a writer** (handoff-v1 F2, `docs/handoff-v1/F2/DESENHO.md` §3). Skills write authorities through the coordinator: `resolve.py draft` → edit the copy in `_drafts/<id>/` → `resolve.py publish` (SU + graph mirror in one operation, one receipt). A direct Edit of the SU is still possible and is **preserved**; this hook reports on stderr what diverged (state changes on existing rows named apart, new rows listed) and the explicit reconciliation — `resolve.py reconcile --engagement <slug>` to see it, `--apply` to publish it through the coordinator. Until then the bootstrap is not ready, `pre-authority-guard.py` denies the next write and the coordinator refuses to publish over the divergent state (T17). It no longer calls `sync_mirror` itself: a hook that published was a second transaction path, and it also mirrored an in-place state promotion without a word (F0 D19). A pending operation, an unreadable graph or legacy mode is reported with its recovery. Never blocks — always exits 0. |
| `on-su-change.py` | `PostToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Active.** On a write to any engagement artefact (`shared-understanding.md`, `_state.json`, `decisions.md`, `story.md`, `council-log.md`, `answers.md`, `options.md`, `frame.md`, `context.json`, `premortem.md`, or anything under `_capture/ _synthesis/ _render/ _blueprint/ _simulation/ _retro/ lens-outputs/ _coverage/`), spawns `library/kernel/tools/dashboard.py` **detached** and regenerates `<engagement>/dashboard.html`. Debounced (default 2 s). Never blocks — always exits 0. |
| ~~`su-confirmed-guard.py`~~ | — | **Retired** (handoff-v1 F2, maintainer decision Q4, 2026-09-23). It warned after the write, only on new `C-` ids, and appended to `council-log.md` from a hook. The rule lives in one place, `dashboard.audit_confirmed_locators` (+ the decision-record rule of `states.md` → *Confirmed threshold*), and is enforced **before** the write: by `pre-authority-guard.py` on a tool write and by `resolve.py publish` on a coordinator publication, both through `workflow.su_problems`. A historical-version engagement is read-only here, so nothing was left for the hook to warn about. |
| `synthesis-validate.py` | `PostToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Active.** On a write to `<engagement>/_synthesis/<topic>.md` (never to `_synthesis-log.md` or `_synthesis-checks.md`), checks the contract of `aisa-synthesize`: `SYN-PARAS` (< 3 paragraphs) · `SYN-NO-IDS` · `SYN-DEAD-ID` (an id with no row in the SU nor block in `decisions.md`) · `SYN-VENDOR` (a term from the pack's `vendor_terms.solution` in a neutral topic — and in `architecture-story` too when no architecture was authorized) · `SYN-TEMPLATE` · `SYN-STAMP` (no `authority:` stamp, or one naming a structurally invalid version; `authority: none — <reason>` is the legitimate no-architecture case). All warnings. Writes to `_synthesis/_synthesis-checks.md` — **never** to `_synthesis-log.md`, whose lines `synthesis_entries()` reads as synthesis runs, so a validation line there would make a stale pack look fresh. The record is history (`sha` of the text, `deps` of the sources); the VERDICT is recomputed on every read (`dashboard.py::synthesis_checks`) because three of the checks depend on the SU, the pack and the blueprint. Exits 0. |
| `blueprint-validate.py` | `PostToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Active.** On a write to `<engagement>/_blueprint/ux-blueprint_vNN.yaml`, runs the kernel's structural check (`dashboard.py::bp_validate` — `blueprint-contract.md` → *Validação estrutural*, 25 codes: YAML subset Y1-Y7, required keys and container types, `architecture` internals, provenance `su_refs`/`su_ref`, `structural`/`resolved`/closure basis, draft, version). Reports to stderr, writes nothing, always exits 0. A `block` issue makes the version non-approvable (aisa-blueprint step 15 refuses mechanically) and an approval already recorded over it non-consumable (`blueprint_state.approved.valid = false`; `render-validate.py`, `--authority-stamp` and the synthesis freshness read that flag). Standalone: `python .claude/hooks/blueprint-validate.py <file>`; the same check by CLI: `python library/kernel/tools/dashboard.py --blueprint-check <file>` (exit 4 when blocking). **It also reports coverage, separately and never merged with structure** (`coverage-contract.md` §8.1): the review published for that exact version, its freshness and its gaps — the F06 case is a version the structural check calls valid that dropped a requirement the SU carried. No record → one line saying it was **not evaluated**, which is neither a pass nor a failure and revokes no approval. The coverage read is read-only: it never finalizes a review. |
| `render-validate.py` | `PostToolUse` on `Write\|Edit` | **Sufficiency by content (P-7).** With `_design/work-packages.json` (handoff-v1 F6.4) it also records the inventory findings of `trace.py`: the implementation-spec projects every `WP-NNNN` with the inventory revision and no duration (`MISSING_IN_SPEC`, `EFFORT_IN_SPEC`, owner `implementation`); the estimate cites each `WP-NNNN` once (`UNESTIMATED_WP`, `DUPLICATE_ESTIMATE`, `STALE_INVENTORY`…, owner `estimate`). On a Write to `_render/<slug>_<deliverable>_v<NN>.md`, executes the rules the deliverable template declares in `sufficiency:` against the APPROVED blueprint's record (following `SEE_Vnn` back-references) and the rendered text — §4 entities without `authority`/dictionary, §6 `(none)` with state machines, §8 without a role matrix, §7 without authentication + secret custody or a named gap. Fails → appends a `## Validação …` block to `render-gaps.md` (owner named) and one stderr line; never blocks the write. CLI: `python .claude/hooks/render-validate.py --engagement <slug> [--dry-run] [--json]`. **It also reports coverage, on its own line and never merged with sufficiency** (`coverage-contract.md` §8.2): the five verdicts of the stage-`render` review of that same file, read through `coverage.py` — the rules are not duplicated here. A sufficient document is not a covered one. No record → one line saying it was **not evaluated**, which is neither a pass nor a failure. The coverage read is read-only, and this hook never writes a coverage finding to `render-gaps.md`: the owner of that finding is the review, recorded by `aisa-render` step 9b. |


## Invocation and the project root

A hook command runs with the **session's** cwd, not the repository root — and the cwd
moves: a single `cd` inside a Bash call is enough. With the relative form
`python .claude/hooks/pre-write-guard.py`, Python then looks for the script under the
new cwd, does not find it, and the `PreToolUse` hook never starts. It fails closed, so
nothing is corrupted — but `Write`, `Edit` and every aisa `Skill` stop working, and the
message names a file that does not exist instead of saying what happened (DEF-P1-02,
measured live in the pilot campaign):

```
PreToolUse:Write hook error: [python .claude/hooks/pre-write-guard.py]:
can't open file '...\projects\smoke\.claude\hooks\pre-write-guard.py'
```

So every command resolves from the project root:

```json
{ "type": "command",
  "command": "python \"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.claude/hooks/pre-write-guard.py\"" }
```

- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is provided to hooks by Claude Code and expanded by the shell —
  verified in the real environment, including roots whose path carries spaces and
  accents. Hence the quotes: this repository's own path has both.
- `:-.` is the fallback for the variable being absent: the command degrades to the old
  relative behaviour instead of pointing at the root of the disk.
- The **scripts** never depended on the cwd (each resolves its root through
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`). The defect was in the registration line only.

**A different condition, which this does not fix.** A session *started* in a subfolder
does not load the repository's `.claude/settings.json` at all — the init event reports
`hooks: null` and no hook is registered, without a warning. Hooks not loaded and hooks
loaded whose command does not resolve are two different states: open the session at the
repository root.

`.claude/tests/test_hook_invocation.py` holds both ends — the registered form, and each
hook actually starting and deciding from the root, from an engagement folder and from a
folder outside the repository.

## Shared code

`_common.py` holds what more than one hook needs: engagement resolution (`find_engagement`, whose ambiguity policy is a parameter — a hook that WRITES refuses to guess, one that only reports keeps the tolerant default), `load_dashboard`, stdin parsing and the `--engagement` / `--override` argument readers.

## Enforcement modes

| Mode | Activation | What enforces |
|---|---|---|
| **Enforce (default)** | Unset or `AISA_GUARD_MODE=enforce` — `.claude/settings.json` sets it explicitly in `env` | `pre-write-guard.py` hard-blocks `library/*` writes. Backed by the `permissions.deny` rules for `Write/Edit(./library/**)` — two independent layers. `pre-authority-guard.py` hard-blocks a write to an engagement authority over unreconstructed state; it has no `deny` backup because the decision depends on the state, not on the path. |
| Log (administrative override) | `AISA_GUARD_MODE=log` | Warnings to stderr, no blocking. The `settings.json` deny rules still apply until removed locally. |

For administrative authoring (populating a pack, editing kernel docs), the sanctioned path per `.claude/rules/library-readonly.md` is an out-of-band edit + `git commit`. The `library/kernel/tools/*.py` scripts are read and **executed** at runtime — execution is never a write, so the guard does not apply to running them.

## Why completeness is checked at `Stop`, not `PostToolUse`

`PostToolUse` on `Skill` fires when the Skill tool **returns** — that is when the instructions are loaded, long before the agent has executed them. At that instant `frame.md` does not exist, so any completeness assertion there is guaranteed to be wrong. `Stop` fires when the turn ends, with every write already on disk; that is the only point at which "did it write everything?" is a fact rather than a guess. `phase-gate-check.py` keeps its `PostToolUse` slot for what it can legitimately observe (which skill ran).

The checks are derived from each skill's own `Outputs (written)` section, not invented — see the citations in the hook's docstring. Being a soft gate is deliberate: CLAUDE.md principle 5 says the only hard rule is `library/` read-only.

## Hooks that spawn subprocesses

`on-su-change.py` is the only hook that launches another process. Three properties make that safe:

- **No loop.** `PostToolUse` fires on the *agent's* `Write`/`Edit` tool calls. The generator writes with `open()` + `os.replace()` inside a subprocess — filesystem I/O, not a tool invocation — so it cannot re-enter the hook. Two cheap guards cover a future model hand-editing the page anyway: the hook returns early on a path ending in `dashboard.html`, and on `AISA_DASHBOARD_RUNNING=1` (set in the child's env).
- **Detached, never awaited.** `subprocess.Popen` with `DEVNULL` on all three streams, plus `CREATE_NO_WINDOW | DETACHED_PROCESS` on Windows and `start_new_session=True` elsewhere. A synchronous run would add ~250 ms to each of the 7 writes a `/round` performs, and any generator bug would become a user-facing hang.
- **Debounced.** The hook skips when `dashboard.html` was written less than `AISA_DASHBOARD_DEBOUNCE` seconds ago (default 2), collapsing a burst of writes into one or two rebuilds. Concurrent generators are still possible; the generator's tmp file carries its pid and lands via `os.replace`, so the worst case is "older build wins for ~2 s", self-corrected on the next write.

**What the hook cannot see.** `PostToolUse` fires on the *agent's* `Write`/`Edit` tool calls and nothing else. A human editing `shared-understanding.md` in an editor, a script, a `git checkout`, or another Claude session writing through Bash all leave the dashboard stale — and because the page reloads itself on a timer, the browser then shows the same old build forever, which reads as "the refresh is broken". For those writers run the generator's own poll loop: `python library/kernel/tools/dashboard.py --engagement <slug> --serve` (stdlib mtime polling, default 2 s, plus an `http://127.0.0.1:8787` server bound to localhost only). Serving matters beyond convenience: over `file://` the page cannot `fetch`, so it can only reload blindly on a timer — and sandboxed contexts refuse even that. Over HTTP it polls `/__build` and reloads only when the build hash changes. Run **one** watcher per engagement: two racing processes let an older build win. The hook stays useful for agent writes: it is instant and costs nothing when idle.

If the generator itself throws, it writes an **error page** to the same path (traceback + the same reload script) and exits 1 — an open browser tab shows the failure instead of silently going stale. The hook ignores the exit code.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AISA_ENGAGEMENTS_ROOT` | `projects/` | Where engagement folders live. Honoured by `on-su-change.py` and `dashboard.py`. |
| `AISA_GUARD_MODE` | `enforce` | `log` downgrades `pre-write-guard.py` **and `pre-authority-guard.py`** to warn-only (administrative override). |
| `AISA_DASHBOARD_RELOAD` | `5` | Browser auto-reload interval, in seconds, baked into the generated page. `0` disables it. |
| `AISA_DASHBOARD_DEBOUNCE` | `2` | Seconds during which `on-su-change.py` skips a rebuild after the last one. |
| `AISA_DASHBOARD_RUNNING` | unset | Set to `1` in the generator's own env; makes the hook a no-op inside it. |

## Why Python (and not bash / PowerShell)

The original MVP shipped bash `.sh` hooks parsing JSON via `jq`. On Windows machines without `jq` (common), the hooks degraded silently to no-op — the lens-order rule wasn't enforced and `pre-write-guard` couldn't run in enforce mode. The fix considered three options:

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Bundle `jq` for Windows | Adds binary dependency; still leaves PowerShell-vs-bash divergence on Win. |
| Maintain `.sh` + `.ps1` in parallel | Drift-prone: any logic change must be applied twice; bugs diverge silently. |
| **Port to Python** | Single source of truth, no external deps (stdlib `json` + `pathlib`), works on every dev machine, faster startup than PowerShell. ✓ |

Python 3.6+ on `PATH` is the only runtime requirement.

## Robustness notes

- **Stdin BOM tolerance.** When PowerShell pipes JSON to a native process, the byte stream may include a UTF-8 BOM (or worse, the BOM re-encoded through Windows-1252 → `ï»¿` as three characters). Each hook strips any leading characters before the first `{`/`[` before calling `json.loads`. Without this, hooks silently failed on Windows in early testing.
- **No active engagement → silent pass.** A hook never blocks when there is no active Discovery engagement — running unrelated skills outside an engagement is always allowed.

## Adding a new hook

1. Create `.claude/hooks/<name>.py`. Follow the existing pattern:
   - Read stdin, strip leading non-JSON bytes, parse with `json.loads`.
   - Inspect `tool_name` + `tool_input.*` fields.
   - To block: print a `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}` JSON to stderr and `sys.exit(2)`.
   - To allow: `sys.exit(0)`. Print informational logs to stderr.
2. Register it in `.claude/settings.json` under the appropriate matcher.
3. Test by piping JSON via `<payload> | python .claude/hooks/<name>.py` and asserting the exit code + stderr.
